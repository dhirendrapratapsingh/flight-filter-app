### `Steps to create Project & add all dependencies in Windows OS`

`Install nodejs npm ` <br>
From the step by step Guide described here [Installation of Node JS on Window](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/installation-of-node-js-on-windows/)

npm install create-react-app -g<br>
create-react-app trello-task-board<br>
cd trello-task-board<br>
npm start<br>

Then open http://localhost:3005/ to see your app., You an configure to any port using .env variable<br>
stop ctrl+c to add dependencies

Copy update package.json with package.json of this project
and run "npm install"

replace src folder with my src folder to get code & resources<br>

npm start<br>
open http://localhost:3000/ to run app again.

The build is minified by Webpack and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!


### Problem Statemnet and basic Features

Create a flight search results and success pages using React as shown in the mockup below,
You're free to use any CSS libraries and colors of your choice to make the UI look better.
The JSON for the search results and airline names comes attached with the mail.

## Objectives

1. Create a search results page with attached flight results data like the UI Mockup shown below.
2. Convert dates in the flight results section to a neatly formatted version as shown in Mockup.
3. Add filter section with the list of airlines from search results JSON, the airline's filter should
be functional(i.e when the checkbox is unchecked/checked the matching flight result should
be either added or removed)
4. When the Book Flight section is clicked the route/page should be redirected to a success
page with selected flight data as shown in the mockup.
5. Bonus, If the site is made responsive which works multiple viewport sizes

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
